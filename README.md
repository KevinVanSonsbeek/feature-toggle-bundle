# Nusje2000/FeatureToggleBundle

## Motivation

At the company I work for, we needed a way to hide unfinished features from custommers. We work with scheduled releases every week and want
to deploy there versions as fast as possible. This bundle provides an implementation of feature toggles, that can be easely intergrated with the
symfony framework.
